Please follow the following programming rules. If you don't, you're a jerk:

Subroutines must be named with Capital Letters and underscores_between_words
	ie) 	Alarm_Clock:
		Display_Temperature_On_Hex:
		Convert_To_BCD:
Labels in subroutines must contain the subroutine's name
	ie)	Alarm_Clock_Loop:
		Display_Temperature_On_Hex_isNegative:
		Convert_To_BCD_Done:

Please include a commentbox specification above each subroutine
It follows the format:
	;
	;Subroutine name
	;What it does
	;Inputs (if any, as in which registers/variables it uses as an "input")
	;Outputs (if any, as in which registers/variables it "outputs")
	;Modifies (the registers that are affected)
	;
